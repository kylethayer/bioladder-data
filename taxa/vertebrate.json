In all vertebrates, the mouth is found at, or right below, the anterior end of the animal, while the anus opens to the exterior before the end of the body. The remaining part of the body continuing after of the anus forms a tail with vertebrae and spinal cord, but no gut.","wikipedia_img":"","wikipedia_page":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrata","popular_ancestors":["chordate","animal","cellular life","life"],"popularity":50,"extinct":false,"name":"vertebrate"}
