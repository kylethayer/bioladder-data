Dicynodonts were herbivorous animals with two tusks, hence their name, which means 'two dog tooth'. They are also the most successful and diverse of the non-mammalian therapsids, with over 70 genera known, varying from rat- to ox-sized.","wikipedia_img":"","wikipedia_page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicynodont","popular_ancestors":["amniote","tetrapod","animal","life"],"popularity":35,"extinct":true,"name":"dicynodont"}
