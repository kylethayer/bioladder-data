One of the major differences between placental and nonplacental eutherians is that placentals lack epipubic bones, which are present in all other fossil and living mammals (marsupials and monotremes).","wikipedia_img":"","wikipedia_page":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placentalia","popular_ancestors":["mammal","amniote","animal","life"],"popularity":"","extinct":false,"name":"placentalia"}
