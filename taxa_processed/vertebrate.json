{"description":"All vertebrates are built along the basic chordate body plan: a stiff rod running through the length of the animal (vertebral column or notochord), with a hollow tube of nervous tissue (the spinal cord) above it and the gastrointestinal tract below. In all vertebrates, the mouth is found at, or right below, the anterior end of the animal, while the anus opens to the exterior before the end of the body. The remaining part of the body continuing after of the anus forms a tail with vertebrae and spinal cord, but no gut.","popularity":50,"extinct":false,"name":"Vertebrate","parentTaxon":"craniata","popularSubtaxa":["lamprey","human","dinosaur"],"exampleMember":"jamoytius","exampleMemberType":"Early Member","taxonomicRank":"Subphylum","scientificName":"","otherNames":[],"wikipediaImg":"","wikipediaPage":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrata","popularAncestors":["chordate","animal","cellular life","life"],"subtaxa":["conodont","hyperoartia","vertebrate subclade 1"]}
