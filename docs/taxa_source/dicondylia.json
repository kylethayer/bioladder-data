"description":"The taxon is distinguished by the possession of a modified mandible with an additional joint canal, which also changes the muscle attachments of the mouth tools and allows a modified mandible movement compared to other mandibles (crustaceans, centipedes). This so-called dicondyle mandible has two joints with which it is attached to the head capsule, while non-insect taxa have only one single ball joint.",
