{"description":"Allotheria is an extinct branch of successful Mesozoic mammals. The most important characteristic was the presence of lower molariform teeth equipped with two longitudinal rows of cusps. Allotheres also had a narrow pelvis, indicating that they gave birth to tiny helpless young like marsupials do. This is a feature of all non-placental mammals.","popularity":"","extinct":true,"name":"Allotheria","parentTaxon":"trechnotheria","popularSubtaxa":["vintana","sunnyodon","taeniolabis"],"exampleMember":"vintana","exampleMemberType":"Example Member","taxonomicRank":"Infraclass","scientificName":"","otherNames":[],"wikipediaImg":"","wikipediaPage":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotheria","popularAncestors":["mammal","amniote","animal","life"],"subtaxa":["multituberculata","sudamericidae"]}
