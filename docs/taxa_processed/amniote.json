"description":"The amniotes have an egg equipped with an amnios, an adaptation to lay eggs on land rather than in water as anamniotes do. These embryonic membranes, and the lack of a larval stage, distinguish amniotes from tetrapod amphibians.\nThe amniotic egg represents a critical divergence within the vertebrates, one enabled to reproduce on dry landâfree of the need to return to water for reproduction as required of the amphibians. From this point the amniotes spread across the globe, eventually to become the dominant land vertebrates.",
