"description": "Except for the opossum, which is a metatherian, all mammals indigenous to North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia are eutherians.\n\nEutherians are distinguished from noneutherians by various features of the feet, ankles, jaws and teeth. One of the major differences between placental and nonplacental eutherians is that placentals lack epipubic bones, which are present in all other fossil and living mammals (marsupials and monotremes).",
