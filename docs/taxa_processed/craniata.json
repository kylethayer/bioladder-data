"description":"In the simplest sense craniates are chordates with heads. The craniate head consists of a brain, sense organs including eyes, and a skull.\n\nIn addition to distinct crania (sing. cranium), craniates possess many derived characteristics which have allowed for more complexity to follow. Molecular-genetic analysis of craniates reveals that, compared to less complex animals, they developed duplicate sets of many gene families that are involved in cell signaling, transcription, and morphogenesis (see homeobox).",
